The Prison Lockdown plugin

HOW TO USE/INSTALL

Place lockdown.jar in your Minecraft/plugins folder and run the server or /reload all.
Now you can use /lockdown set 1 and /lockdown set 2 to set both warp locations.
Now with both of the locations set and saved to the /lockdown/config.yml you can use /lockdown on 10 s to enable a 10 second lockdown or /lockdown on 5 m to enable a 5 minute lockdown. You can use any 4 digit numbers followed by 's' for seconds or 'm' for minutes.
After a couple of updates the config.yml might get filled with useless stuff, so a reset(deletion of the config.yml) might help you to see it better.
